# Algolia Duplicate Cleaner

## Overview
This Python script is designed to help clean up duplicate entries in an Algolia index. It identifies duplicates based on URL and date of scraping, providing an efficient way to maintain the integrity and relevance of your Algolia data.

## Features
- **User Input for Algolia Credentials**: Prompts the user to enter their Algolia Application ID, Admin API Key, and Index Name.
- **Duplicate Identification**: Scans the specified Algolia index and identifies duplicates based on URL and `date_scraping`.
- **Interactive Duplicate Review**: Allows users to review the found duplicates in batches of 10 before deciding to delete them.
- **JSON Backup Option**: Offers an option to save a backup of the current index and identified duplicates in JSON format.
- **Safe Deletion with Confirmation**: Ensures that duplicates are only deleted after user confirmation, preventing accidental data loss.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Algolia account and API credentials

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script directly.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Install the `algoliasearch` Python package if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install algoliasearch
   ```

## Usage
Run the script in your Python environment:
```bash
python algolia_clean_duplicate.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Algolia credentials and manage duplicates in your index.
